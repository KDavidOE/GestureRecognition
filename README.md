# GestureRecognition
This project provides a software to control PowerPoint presentation using hand gestures.

The main goal is to create a robust system that can tackle difficulties such as dynamic background.
Dynamic background could be the occurance of multiple moving hands in a frame, differenct skin colors, not sufficient lighting and shadows.

The solution provides a Convolutional Neural Network for this task and a Conditional Generative Adverserial Network.
The GUI is implemented using PySimpleGui, and the system calls performed with PyWin32.
